# gitignore.io command line utility

[gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io) is GREAT. And i use it alot!

But i'm too lazy going to the website all the time.

So here is a very simple command line script to gitignore.io:


Generate gitignore file:
````bash
gitignore Unity visualstudiocode >> .gitignore
````

Don't forget to enable bash completion :)
